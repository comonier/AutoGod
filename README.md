# 🛡️ AutoGod - Minecraft Plugin (1.21.1)

**AutoGod** is a robust and lightweight solution for managing invulnerability (God mode) and flight (Fly mode) on your Minecraft server. It offers a powerful persistence system and automatic activation based on specific groups, nicknames, and permissions.

- **Persistence:** Manual God/Fly states are saved in `data.yml` and restored after server restarts.
- **Full Vault Integration:** Automatic detection for multiple administration and moderator groups.
- **Secret Priority:** Dedicated auto-activation logic for the user `comonier`.
- **Fully Customizable:** English messages by default, translatable via `messages.yml`.
